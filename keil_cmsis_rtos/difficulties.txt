Difficulties with Keil's CMSIS implementation
=============================================

* Whenever a mutex, a semaphore etc. is initialized, the implementation checks
  if the control block is zero. This is problematic, especially when the
  control block is allocated on the stack.

* The CMSIS-OS API specifies the delay function as
      osStatus osDelay(uint32_t millisec).
  This suggests a maximum delay time of approximately 4e9 ms. However, the
  CMSIS-RTX internals are still 16 bit code. This limits the maximum wait time
  to 65534 ticks (not milliseconds - ticks!).

* The implementation uses ticks internally to store when to wakeup a waiting
  thread. A delay of 1 wakes a thread at the beginning of the next tick period.
  As time has already passed in the current period, the sleep time is less
  than 1 tick. In other words, the tick delay is an upper bound and the sleep
  time might be up to one tick less than specified.
